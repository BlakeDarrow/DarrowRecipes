Butter Dip Biscuits
###########################################################
 
Ingredients
=========================================================
 
- 1/2 c salter butter (1 stick)
- 2 1/2 c flour
- 1 1/2 Tbsp granulated sugar
- 1 Tbsp aluminum free baking powder
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 3/2 c buttermilk +
 
Prep
=========================================================
 
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Spray a glass or ceramic 8x8 or 9x9 baking dish with oil. Ina microwave safe bowl, melt the stick of butter. Pour melted butter into the prepared baking dish.
 
Directions
=========================================================
 
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt. Pour in the buttermilk. Stir until a stocky batter forms, if batter still seems too dry add a tad bit more buttermilk until batter thick and sticky. Pour biscuit dough into baking dish (right on top of the melted butter). Some of the butter will run over the top of the dough. Cut the dough into 9 squares (as best you can). This will help with cutting later when the biscuits are baked. Bake on middle rack for 25-30 minutes, rotating dish once during baking. Oven times do vary, but basically biscuits should be golden brown on top and spring back to the touch. You can test using a toothpick if you wish. Enjoy.
