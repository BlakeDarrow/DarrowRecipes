Ingredients

- Coarse ground coffee (regular or decaf)
- water
 
Prep
=========================================================
 

 
Directions
=========================================================
 
1. Grind your coffee on coarse. Add your grinds to a french press, or a large mason jar or pitcher along with water in a 1:4 ratio (for example, I like to use 1/4 cup of coffee grounds to 1 cup of water).
2. Stir the mixture so all the coffee grounds are soaked, then cover with a lid and let steep for 24 hours (if using a french press, leave the filter up while steeping).
3. Once 24 hours have passed, strain the coffee grounds out using a fine mesh sieve, cheesecloth, or filter.
4. This recipe makes concentrate, so dilute to your desired strength (I typically dilute 1:1 with water or milk). Enjoy!
