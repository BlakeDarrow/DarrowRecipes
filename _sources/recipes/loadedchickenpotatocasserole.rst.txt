=========================================================
 
- 5 medium Russet potatoes, peeled and rinsed, then cut in 1-inch pieces

Prep
=========================================================
 
- Preheat oven to 400F

Directions
=========================================================
 
- Spread the cut potatoes evenly in the baking dish. Drizzle with 1 Tablespoon olive oil then toss to coat. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven for 40 minutes.
- While potatoes are cooking, whisk together the remaining olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Add the diced chicken to the mixture and stir to coat.
- When potatoes are finished cooking carefully remove from oven. Pour the seasoned diced chicken all over the potatoes and can of diced green chilis and carefully toss to combine everything.
