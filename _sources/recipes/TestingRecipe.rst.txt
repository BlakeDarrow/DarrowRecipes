Directions
=========================================================
 
- Boil 6 cups of water in a large pot over high heat and cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain the pasta, rinse with cold water, so it doesnt clump, can also toss a little olive oil on it to prevent clumping, and set aside.
- While the pasta is cooking, add the butter, olive oil and onion to a large pot over medium-high heat and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent.
- Add the red bell pepper, garlic, Cajun seasoning, basil, paprika, ground black pepper, salt and cayenne pepper. Stir to combine and cook for 3 more minutes or until the bell pepper starts to become soft.
- Add the chicken and stir and cook for another 6 to 8 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
- Add the parmesan, heavy cream, cream cheese and chicken broth and stir and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until the sauce starts to thicken and the cream cheese has fully melted.
- Add the cooked and drained pasta and stir to coat pasta with sauce. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then serve with freshly chopped parsley on top, if desired.
