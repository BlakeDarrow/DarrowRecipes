Easy 20 minute gluten free drop biscuits
###########################################################
 
Ingredients
=========================================================
 
- 1 3/4 cup flour
- 3/4 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it
- 1/4 cup cornstarch or potato starch or arrowroot
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 2 tsp granulated sugar
- 8 Tbsp unsalted butter cut into a quarter inch dice or grated in chilled
- 1 cup (8 fluid ounces) buttermilk chilled
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter melted
 
Prep
=========================================================
 
Preheat your oven to 425. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper and set it aside.
 
Directions
=========================================================
 
In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar, and whisk to combine well. Add the diced or grated and chilled butter and mix to combine. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients, add the buttermilk and mix until just combined. Working quickly, so the dough doesn't get warm, drop the batter by the quarter cup using two large spoons or a 2 inch ice cream scoop about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Do not pack the dough into the ice cream scoop. Press the mounds of dough jet down gently to flatten the tops and brush lightly with the melted butter. Placed a baking sheet in the center of the preheated oven and bake until likely golden brown all over about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to set briefly before serving.
