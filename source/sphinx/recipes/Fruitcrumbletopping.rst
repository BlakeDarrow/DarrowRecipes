Stephanie's :Mix all ingredients together. Pour on fruit - approximately 4 cups. Add a little cornstarch if the fruit is runny. Bake at 350° until browned for approximately 30 to 40 minutes. For peaches I peel and slice 8 to 10 covered with water and boil until thickened.  For Tricias:  peach cobbler with 4 cups of peeled and cut peaches she adds one stick of butter and 2 cups of sugar and boils the peaches then pours on the crust and bakes at 450.   Also for her crust she doesn't use the crumble topping but mixes up 1 cup flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 cup +1 Tbsp shortening +2 Tbsp cold water and mixes to top peaches.
