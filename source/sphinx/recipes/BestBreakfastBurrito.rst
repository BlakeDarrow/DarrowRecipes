Best Breakfast Burrito
###########################################################
 
Ingredients
=========================================================
 
- 1 lb small round yellow potatoes, cut into 1.2 inch pieces
- Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- Pinches of red pepper flakes
- 1 red bell pepper
- 3 12" tortillas
- 1 c spinach
- 1/2 c shredded red cabbage
- 9 scrambled eggs
- 3/4 c cooked black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 c pico de gallo
- 1 ripe avocado
- 1/2 c cilantro leaves
- sea salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 lime for squeezing
- Cilantro lime dressing for dipping
 
Prep
=========================================================
 
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment pepper. 
 You can make sausage and/or bacon to add and set up a bar rather so people can make their own.
 
Directions
=========================================================
 
1. Place the potatoes on the the sheet, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper, the smoke paprika and pinches of red pepper flakes.  Toss to coat, spread evenly on the pan and bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown and crisp around the edges.
2. Heat a grill pan on the stove to medium heat.  Place the red pepper on the pan and let it char for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until the pepper is soft and each side has black grill marks.  Alternately, you can roast it in the oven until soft.  Remove from the grill, remove the stem and ribbing and slice the pepper into strips.
3. Assemble the burritos: Divide the spinach leaves and red cabbage, if using, on the tortillas.  Top with scrambled eggs, red pepper stripes, black beans, pico de gallo, potatoes, avocado, and cilantro.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lime.  Fold the left and right sides of the tortilla over the filling.  Fold the bottom flap of the burrito up and over the filling, tucking the sides and the filling as you roll the burrito.  Wrap in foil and serve with cilatrno lime dressing for dipping.
