Using tongs, flip the chicken and transfer the skillet into the oven to roast until 165F, 12 to 15 minutes.  Transfer the chicken to a plate and tent with aluminum foil; reserving the skillet and set aside.
2. Return the skillet to the stove over medium heat and add shallots; cook until shallots are tender, about 2 minutes. Add the wine, chicken broth, and lemon juice using a silicone spatula to scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring the liquid to a boil and continue to cook until it has reduced by half.  Reduce the heat to simmer, stir in the mustard and cream and simmer until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes.  Add herbs and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
3. To serve: Place chicken breasts on dinner plates and spoon sauce over each one, serve immediately.
