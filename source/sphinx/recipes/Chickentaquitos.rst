Chicken taquitos
###########################################################
 
Ingredients
=========================================================
 
- 2 big cans chicken
- 1/4 tsp cumin 
- 1/4 tsp chili powder 
- 1/4 tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp salt 
- 1/4 tsp pepper 
- 1/8-1/4 tsp chipotle chili powder, optional (this will give them some kick!)
- 3-4 Tbsp cilantro (parsley or green onion will also work), minced 
- 1 heaping tablespoon your favorite salsa (red or green)
- about 12 corn tortillas (have more, sometimes it makes more depending on how much filling you out in) - olive oil **highly suggest serving with guacamole and salsa to dip*
 
Prep
=========================================================
 
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. 
- Grease a baking sheet with spray olive oil or brush with olive oil. 
- warm tortillas slightly (I wrap 6 at a time in a damp paper towel or kitchen cloth and microwave about 30 seconds. 
 
Directions
=========================================================
 
1. Make filling by stirring together chicken, spices, cilantro, and salsa. Stir to combine. The mixture should not be very wet (they'll roll better and stay together better if the filling isn't very wet).
2. ** VERY IMPORTANT so they don't tear* To assemble, warm tortillas slightly (I wrap 6 at a time in a damp paper towel or kitchen cloth and microwave about 30 seconds. Alternatively, you can wrap them in a damp towel and put them in a warm oven for about 5 minutes or so, or individually warm them in a pan on the stovetop. 
3. For each taquito, spoon about 3-4 Tbsp of the chicken mixture down the center of the tortilla. Gently roll up as tightly as you can and place seam side down on a greased baking sheet. 
4. When all taquitos are rolled, brush the tops with a little olive oil or mist lightly with spray olive oil. 
5. Bake at 375 degrees 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are just starting to brown. Serve with your favorite salsa, guacamole, or taco toppings!
