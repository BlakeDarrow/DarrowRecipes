Coffee Chocolate Chip Cookies
###########################################################
 
Ingredients
=========================================================
 
- 3/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup finely ground coffee or espresso powder
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 1/3 cup white sugar
- 1 egg and 1 egg yolk
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 3/4 cup flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 4 oz (about half a standard bag) chocolate chips or chopped chocolate
- flaky/coarse salt
 
Prep
=========================================================
 
- Brown the butter in a saucepan until fragrant and toasty.
- Once butter is browned, remove it from the heat and pour in the coffee to steep in the hot butter. Allow to cool to room temperature.
 
Directions
=========================================================
 
1. In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer, add the brown butter/coffee mixture, brown sugar and white sugar. Beat together.
2. Add in the egg, egg yolk and vanilla extract.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, salt and baking soda.
4. Mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until everything comes together. Then, fold in the chocolate chips.
5. Allow dough to chill in the fridge for at least half an hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
6. Use a cookie scoop to portion the dough onto a cookie sheet and give each ball a generous sprinkle of flaky salt.
7. Bake cookies in the oven for 11 minutes. The edges should be set and the middle still slightly soft and puffy. The cookies will continue to cook with residual heat once you pull them out of the oven.
8. Allow cookies to cool, then enjoy! These are caffeinated, so be aware of when you eat them!
