Cheesy Zucchini Breadsticks
###########################################################
 
Ingredients
=========================================================
 
- 4 c grated zucchini
- 1/2 c mozarella cheese
- 1/3 c parmesan cheese
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp garlic parsley salt
- 1 c grated cheese of choice (for topping)
 
Prep
=========================================================
 
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease it to prevent sticking.  Place the zucchini in a colander over the sink, sprinkle a little salt over if and leet sit for about 10 minutes.  Afterward squeeze out as much excess water as possible using your hands or a clean kitchen towel.  This step is essential to avoid soggy breadsticks.
 
Directions
=========================================================
 
1. In a large bowl, combine the drained zucchini, mozarella, parmesan, egg and garlic parsley salt.  Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
2. Transfer the zucchini mixture to the prepared baking sheet.  Press it into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick, ensuring the thickness is uniform so the breadsticks cook evenly.
3. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the base has firmed up and turned golden brown.
4. Remove the breadsticks from the oven and sprinkle your choice of grated cheese on top.  Return to the oven and bake an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
5. For an extra golden and crispy top, switch the oven to broil and broil the breadsticks for 2-3 minutes, watching closely to prevent burning.
6. Allow the breadsticks to cool for a few minutes before cutting them into strips.  Serve warm, with marina sauce for dipping if desired.
