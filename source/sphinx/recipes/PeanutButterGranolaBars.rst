Peanut Butter Granola Bars
###########################################################
 
Ingredients
=========================================================
 
- 1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
- 1/2 cup peanut butter, melted,, reserve 1 Tbsp for drizzle
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup pecans, coarsly chopped
- 1/2 cup sliced almonds
- 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds
- 1/2 cup desiccated/shredded coconut, unsweetened

 
Prep
=========================================================
 
Line a 9X9 inch square plan with parchment paper.  Melt the peanut butter and coconut oil in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Reserve 1 Tbsp of peanut butter for drizzle.
 
Directions
=========================================================
 
1. In a large bowl combine the nuts, seeds and shredded coconut and sugar together.  Once mixed, pour the melted peanut butter and coconut oil over the granola.  Toss until the nuts, seeds and coconut are fully coated.
2. Pour the granola into the square pan.  Use a spatula to spread the granola evenly across the pan and firmly press the granola down.  Place the your pan of granola in the freezer for at least an hour to harden. 
3. Once the granola has hardened lift it from the pan and cut into 18 bars using a knife.  Some of the peanut butter will have settled at the bottom coating the bottom granola.
4. Mix the reserved peanut butter and a little syrup together, melt in microwave for 15-30 seconds and then drizzle it over your frozen cut bars.  The peanut butter drizzle will harden as it touches the frozen granola.
